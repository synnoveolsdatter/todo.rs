# It's a todo list!

BIIIG plans for it, hopefully I finish this one

For example:
    > I plan on making it a CLI so that you can access the program from whereever, maybe even a Desktop App! One step at a time though.
    > Probably gonna do something with the bar graphs because I can't NOT, they look so cool lol
